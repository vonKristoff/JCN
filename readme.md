### Frontend Developer (5 years professional placement)



> I have a great understanding of Web based applications, and really like the appropriate use of data-driven web components, defined by libraries such as React and Vue.

> From design mockups to prototypes, Restful API's and Webhooks or just plain old Javascript, I believe in the web.

## Cover

As Frontend Developer, I can build prototypes from design briefs, through to pixel perfect TDD deployments. I enjoy working out a UI puzzel, on my own or within a team. I have a nak for layout, and enjoy storyboarding user flow, with designers, managers and developers.

I always have browser performance in mind, which is integral to the development of any feature and whether it ends up as a _strong man_ or _athlete_.

I am always open to learning new technologies, and trying new approaches. There's always something to take away, even if in hindsight.

By working with API's, it has helped my Frontend knowledge considerably, especially with asynchronous techniques and being able to document interfaces, types, models and collections and realise this clearly in my client side application as well as discuss such features with backend engineers. 

I like my code modular and resuable; always making snippet notes. I like to share tips with other developers and learn from all players. I am ready to suggest new approaches, but also am very happy to align the practice so that the code base follows the rules of the house.

## Experience Roadmap ⚡

### ScanLAB Projects

**Web Developer** : `3 years` _Full Time_

> From building in-house tools to aid productivity for the rest of the team, to standalone web based applications as exhibits in Museums.

As Web Developer amongst a multi disciplonary team of Artists, Architects, Photographers and Engineers, I was responsible to bring the best of web technologies into the upcoming accomplishments created at ScanLAB. This meant my role would need to adapt to cover new ground and look at using the web in whatever capacity it could suit an upcoming project that would be using the cutting edge in-house software to render Pointcloud data as a story driven aesthetic. From building in-house tools to aid productivity for the rest of the team, to standalone web based applications as exhibits in Museums, I would need to be self motivated to design, architect and build within a fluid environment.

* The Postal Museum - MailRail Digital Interactive (SPA)
* The Sir John Soane Museum - A Museum Made Digital (SPA)
* Mobile Application for National Geographic (Mobile)
* Client Delivery Interface (API | Client) - A preview media system with version control, commenting and video transcoding

The developers have an application host system that mini SPA apps load into their unique custom framework, and my job was to build an application to fit into this stack.

The purpose of the SPA is a layout manager, that is in charge of queing animations and live video streams, and placing them at certain positions dependant on the table data received from the main application host.

I was part of a team of 4, where I was responsible for the FE build of the site, that took over from the Full Stack engineer who was handling the logic between api controllers.

I was able to contribute to the build of the stack, by introducing Gulp and Jade into the project.
